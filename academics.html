        <pre style="margin-left: 15%;">
        <ul>
            <li><b>PO1.</b> Engineering knowledge: Apply the knowledge of mathematics, science, engineering 
            fundamentals, and an engineering specialization to the solution of complex engineering
            problems.</li>
            <li><b>PO2.</b> Problem analysis: Identify, formulate, research literature, and analyze complex 
            engineering problems reaching substantiated conclusions using first principles of 
            mathematics, natural sciences, and engineering sciences.</li>
            <li><b>PO3.</b> Design/development of solutions: Design solutions for complex engineering problems
            and design system components or processes that meet the specified needs with appropriate 
            consideration for the public health and safety, and the cultural, societal, and 
            environmental considerations.</li>
            <li><b>PO4.</b> Conduct investigations of complex problems: Use research-based knowledge and research 
            methods including design of experiments, analysis and interpretation of data, and synthesis of
            the information to provide valid conclusions.</li>
            <li><b>PO5.</b> Modern tool usage: Create, select, and apply appropriate techniques, resources, and modern
            engineering and IT tools including prediction and modeling to complex engineering activities with
            an understanding of the limitations.</li>
            <li><b>PO6.</b> The engineer and society: Apply reasoning informed by the contextual knowledge to assess societal,
            health, safety, legal and cultural issues and the consequent responsibilities relevant to the 
            professional engineering practice.</li>
            <li><b>PO7.</b> Environment and sustainability: Understand the impact of the professional engineering solutions in
            societal and environmental contexts, and demonstrate the knowledge of, and need for sustainable development.</li>
            <li><b>PO8.</b> Ethics: Apply ethical principles and commit to professional ethics and responsibilities and norms of 
            the engineering practice.</li>
            <li><b>PO9.</b> Individual and team work: Function effectively as an individual, and as a member or leader in diverse 
            teams, and in multidisciplinary settings.</li>
            <li><b>PO10.</b> Communication: Communicate effectively on complex engineering activities with the engineering community 
            and with society at large, such as, being able to comprehend and write effective reports and design documentation,
            make effective presentations, and give and receive clear instructions.</li>
            <li><b>PO11.</b> Project management and finance: Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the engineering and management 
            principles and apply these to oneâ€™s own work, as a member and leader in a team, to manage projects and in 
            multidisciplinary environments.</li>
            <li><b>PO12.</b> Life-long learning: Recognize the need for, and have the preparation and ability to engage in independent 
            and lifelong learning in the broadest context of technological change.</li>
